# PyDentity Wallet

## Overview
PyDentity Wallet is a Python-based Progressive Web Application (PWA) designed to provide mobile wallet functionality for ACA-Py (Aries Cloud Agent Python). It enables seamless access to mobile wallet features and browser APIs, offering a frontend for managing multi-tenant ACA-Py instances.

## Features
- **Multi-Tenant ACA-Py Support**: Connects to ACA-Py instances and allows users to manage subwallets.
- **Mobile Device Binding**: Securely stores wallet data in an ecrypted remote session bound to a mobile device.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works on iOS and Android via browser-based access.
- **Open Standards Compliance**: Utilizes W3C, IETF, DIF, and other open standards whenever possible.

## Project Status
PyDentity Wallet is currently in the **Labs** stage under the OpenWallet Foundation. The project is actively developed as an open-source initiative to enhance the usability of decentralized identity solutions.

## Usage
### Development
To get started quickly, you can leverage the development agent available and an ngrok tunnel for the server.

### Pre-requisites
- Free NGROK account and auth token
- Docker installed

Clone this repository, then create your `.env` file:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:openwallet-foundation-labs/PyDentity-Wallet.git
cd PyDentity-Wallet
cp .env.example .env

```

Update the `.env` file with your NGROK token.

Build the image and run the server:
```
docker build --tag pydentity-wallet --file docker/Dockerfile .
docker run --env-file .env pydentity-wallet

```

You should see a QR code displayed in the console. This is your ngrok endpoint. Scan this with a mobile phone to access the wallet app.

### Creating an instance
- Upon your first visit to the app domain, you will be prompted to create a webauthn login credential. Fingerprint binding is our recommended method.
- When you visit the domain successively, you will be promtped to login with your webauthn login credential.
- If you clear the page data in your browser, you will permanently loose access to your instance, beware.
    - Email recovery might be a feature made available in the future.
